# 👋 Hi, I'm Dhruvish Parekh

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at Stevens Institute of Technology, passionate about building **real-time multiplayer systems**, designing **scalable architectures**, and experimenting with **AI-powered infrastructure**.

Currently focused on:
- 🧠 Agentic AI systems + observability
- ⚡ Multiplayer game engines & WebSocket architectures
- 🎯 FAANG interview prep with LeetCode + systems projects

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🏢 [LobbyBase – Real-Time Multiplayer Lobby System](https://github.com/dhruvish20/multiplayer-lobby-template)
A real-time multiplayer virtual office built from scratch with React, Phaser, Node.js, WebSocket, MongoDB, and Redis.  
Features real-time chat, JWT auth, and stress-tested session architecture.

> ⚙️ Scales to 600+ users | 🧩 Built from scratch | 💬 Live in-game messaging

---

### 🔦 [TorchCommit (In Progress)](https://github.com/dhruvish20/torchcommit)
An experiment tracking framework for PyTorch projects that auto-logs code, metrics, and system stats at every commit.  
Supports versioning, CLI-based querying, and experiment comparisons — ideal for ML reproducibility.

> 🧪 Git-integrated experiment logging | 🧠 Lightweight & CLI-first | 🛠️ In active development
